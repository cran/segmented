\title{
Variance-Covariance Matrix for a Fitted Segmented Model
}
\description{
Returns the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters estimates (including breakpoints) of a
     fitted stepmented model object.
}
\usage{
\method{vcov}{stepmented}(object, k=NULL, return.X=FALSE, zero.cor=TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
a fitted model object of class "stepmented", returned by any \code{stepmented} method
}
  \item{k}{
The power of \code{n} for the smooth approximation. Simulation evidence suggests \code{k} in [-1, -1/2]; with k=-1/2 providing somewhat 'conservative' standard errors especially at small sample sizes.
}
\item{return.X}{
If \code{TRUE}, the (pseudo) design matrix is returned (into a list).
}
\item{zero.cor}{
If \code{TRUE}, the covariances between the jumpoints and the remaining linear coefficients are set to zero.
}
\item{\dots}{
additional arguments. }
}
\details{
The full covariance matrix is based on the smooth approximation 
\deqn{I(x>\psi)\approx \Phi((x-\psi)/n^{k})} 
via the sandwich formula using the empirical information matrix and assuming \eqn{x \in [0,1]}. \eqn{\Phi(\cdot)} is the standard Normal cdf, and \eqn{k} is the argument \code{k}. When \code{k=NULL} (default), it is computed via
\deqn{k=-(0.6 + 0.3 \ \log(snr) - (|\hat\psi-0.5|/n)^{1/2})}
 where \eqn{snr} is the signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to the estimated changepoint \eqn{\hat\psi} (in the range (0,1)). The above formula comes from extensive simulation studies under different scenarios.
}
\value{
The full matrix of the estimated covariances between the parameter estimates, including 
the breakpoints.

\note{
If the fit \code{object} has been called by \code{stepmented(.., var.psi=TRUE)}, then \code{vcov.stepmented} will return \code{object$vcov}, unless the power \code{k} differs from \code{-2/3}.
