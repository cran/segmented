\title{
Points method for segmented objects
}
\description{
  Takes a fitted \code{segmented} object returned by \code{segmented()} and adds
  on the current plot the joinpoints of the fitted broken-line relationships.
}
\usage{
  \method{points}{segmented}(x, term, interc = TRUE, link = TRUE, rev.sgn=FALSE, 
    transf=I, .vcov=NULL, .coef=NULL, const=0, v=TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
an object of class \code{segmented}.
}
  \item{term}{
the segmented variable of interest. It may be unspecified when there is a single segmented variable.
}
  \item{interc}{
If \code{TRUE} the computed joinpoints include the model intercept (if it exists).
}
  \item{link}{
when \code{TRUE} (default), the fitted joinpoints are plotted on the link scale
}
  \item{rev.sgn}{
when \code{TRUE}, the fitted joinpoints are plotted on the `minus' scale
of the current \code{term} variable. This is useful when a null-constraint 
has been set on the last slope.
}
  \item{transf}{
A possible function to convert the fitted values before plotting.
}
  \item{.vcov}{ The \emph{full} covariance matrix of estimates. If unspecified (i.e. \code{NULL}), the covariance matrix is computed internally by \code{vcov()}.}
  \item{.coef}{ The regression parameter estimates. If unspecified (i.e. \code{NULL}), it is computed internally by \code{coef(x)}.}
  \item{const}{ A constant to be added (on the y-scale) to the values before transforming and plotting.}
  \item{v}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, vertical lines at the breakpoints are also drawn.}
  \item{\dots}{
other graphics parameters to pass on to \code{points()} and \code{segments()} (if \code{v=TRUE}).
}
}
\details{
We call 'joinpoint' the plane point having as coordinates the breakpoints (on the x scale) and the fitted values of
the segmented relationship at that breakpoints (on the y scale). \code{points.segmented()} simply adds the fitted 
joinpoints on the current plot. This could be useful to emphasize the changes of the piecewise linear relationship.
