\title{ Testing for existence of one breakpoint}
\description{
  Given a (generalized) linear model, the (pseudo) Score statistic tests for the existence of one breakpoint.
}
\usage{
pscore.test(obj, seg.Z, k = 10, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), 
    values=NULL, dispersion=NULL, df.t=NULL, more.break=FALSE, n.break=1, 
    only.term=FALSE, break.type=c("break","jump"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{ a fitted model typically returned by \code{glm} or \code{lm}. Even an object returned by 
  \code{segmented} can be set. Offset and weights are allowed.}
  \item{seg.Z}{ a formula with no response variable, such as \code{seg.Z=~x1}, indicating the (continuous) segmented variable being tested. Only a single variable may be tested and an error is printed when \code{seg.Z} includes two or more terms. \code{seg.Z} can be omitted if i)\code{obj} is a segmented fit with a single segmented covariate (and that variable is taken), or ii)if it is a "lm" or "glm" fit with a single covariate (and that variable is taken).}
  \item{k}{ optional. Number of points (equi-spaced from the min to max) used to compute the pseudo Score statistic. See Details. }
  \item{alternative}{ a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis (relevant to the slope difference parameter). }
  \item{values}{ optional. The evaluation points where the Score test is computed. See Details for default values.}
  \item{dispersion}{ optional. the dispersion parameter for the family to be used to compute the test statistic.
      When \code{NULL} (the default), it is inferred from \code{obj}. Namely it is taken as \code{1} for the
     Binomial and Poisson families, and otherwise estimated by the residual Chi-squared statistic in the model \code{obj} (calculated from cases with non-zero weights divided by the residual degrees of freedom).}
  \item{df.t}{ optional. The degress-of-freedom used to compute the p-value. When \code{NULL}, the df extracted from \code{obj} are used.}
  \item{more.break}{ optional, logical. If \code{obj} is a 'segmented' fit, \code{more.break=FALSE} tests for the actual breakpoint for the variable 'seg.Z', 
  while \code{more.break=TRUE} tests for an \emph{additional} breakpoint(s) for the variable 'seg.Z'. Ignored when \code{obj} is not a segmented fit.}
  \item{n.break}{optional. Number of breakpoints postuled under the alternative hypothesis.}
  \item{only.term}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, only the pseudo covariate(s) relevant to the testing for the breakpoint is returned, and no test is computed.}
\item{break.type}{The kind of breakpoint being tested. \code{"break"} is for piecewise-linear relationships, \code{"jump"} means piecewise-constant, i.e. a step-function, relationships.}
}
\details{
  \code{pscore.test} tests for a non-zero difference-in-slope parameter of a segmented
  relationship. Namely, the null hypothesis is \eqn{H_0:\beta=0}{H_0:beta=0}, where \eqn{\beta}{beta} is the difference-in-slopes, 
  i.e. the coefficient of the segmented function \eqn{\beta(x-\psi)_+}{beta*(x-psi)_+}. The hypothesis of interest 
  \eqn{\beta=0}{beta=0} means no breakpoint. Simulation studies have shown that such Score test is more powerful than the Davies test (see reference) when the alternative hypothesis is `one changepoint'. If there are two or more breakpoints (for instance, a sinusoidal-like relationships), \code{pscore.test} can have lower power, and \code{\link{davies.test}} can perform better.
  
  The \code{dispersion} value, if unspecified, is taken from \code{obj}. If \code{obj} represents the fit under the null hypothesis (no changepoint), the dispersion parameter estimate will be usually larger, leading to a (potentially severe) loss of power.  
  
  The \code{k} evaluation points are \code{k} equally spaced values in the range of the segmented covariate. \code{k} should not be small. 
  Specific values can be set via \code{values}, although I have found no important difference due to number and location of the evaluation points, thus  default is \code{k=10} equally-spaced points. However, when the possible breakpoint is believed to lie into a specified narrower range, the user can specify \code{k} values in that range leading to higher power in detecting it, i.e. typically lower p-value.
  
  If \code{obj} is a (segmented) \emph{lm} object, the returned p-value comes from the t-distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom. Otherwise, namely if \code{obj} is a (segmented) \emph{glm} object, the p-value is computed wrt the Normal distribution.
