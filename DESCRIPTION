Description: Fitting regression models where, in addition to possible linear terms, one or more covariates have segmented (i.e., broken-line 
  or piece-wise linear) or stepmented (i.e. piece-wise constant) effects. 
  Multiple breakpoints for the same variable are allowed. The estimation method is discussed in Muggeo (2003, <doi:10.1002/sim.1545>) and 
  illustrated in Muggeo (2008, <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-1.pdf>). An approach for hypothesis testing is presented 
  in Muggeo (2016, <doi:10.1080/00949655.2016.1149855>), and interval estimation for the breakpoint is discussed in Muggeo (2017, <doi:10.1111/anzs.12200>). 
  Segmented mixed models, i.e. random effects in the change point, are discussed in Muggeo (2014, <doi:10.1177/1471082X13504721>).
  Estimation of piecewise-constant relationships and changepoints (mean-shift models) is 
  discussed in Fasola et al. (2018, <doi:10.1007/s00180-017-0740-4>).
